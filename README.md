## ðŸŒŸ **Why This Project Matters**  

In the digital world, spam messages waste time and compromise user experience. By leveraging machine learning, we can distinguish between spam and legitimate messages (ham) with impressive accuracy and efficiency. Whether youâ€™re curious about AI or looking to implement a spam filter, this project is your go-to resource.

## ðŸš€ **How It Works**  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Clean and prepare the raw text data for training using tokenization, stopword removal, and more.  

2. **Model Training**  
   Train and fine-tune four machine learning models to classify spam and ham.  

3. **Performance Evaluation**  
   Compare each model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and visualize results using confusion matrices.  

4. **In-Depth Analysis**  
   Focus on SVM misclassifications to identify improvement opportunities.
